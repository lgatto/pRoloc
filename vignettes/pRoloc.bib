Protocols continue to increase in complexity as methods and technologies evolve and diversify. To encourage the standardized collection, integration, storage and dissemination of proteomics data, the Human Proteome Organization’s Proteomics Standards Initiative develops guidance modules for reporting the use of techniques such as gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. This paper describes the processes and principles underpinning the development of these modules; discusses the ramifications for various interest groups such as experimentalists, funders, publishers and the private sector; addresses the issue of overlap with other reporting guidelines; and highlights the criticality of appropriate tools and resources in enabling ’MIAPE-compliant’ reporting.},

        Abstract = {We describe here a multiplexed protein quantitation strategy that provides relative and absolute measurements of proteins in complex mixtures. At the core of this methodology is a multiplexed set of isobaric reagents that yield amine-derivatized peptides. The derivatized peptides are indistinguishable in MS, but exhibit intense low-mass MS/MS signature ions that support quantitation. In this study, we have examined the global protein expression of a wild-type yeast strain and the isogenic upf1Delta and xrn1Delta mutant strains that are defective in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and the general 5’ to 3’ decay pathways, respectively. We also demonstrate the use of 4-fold multiplexing to enable relative protein measurements simultaneously with determination of absolute levels of a target protein using synthetic isobaric peptide standards. We find that inactivation of Upf1p and Xrn1p causes common as well as unique effects on protein expression.},

Previous proteomic studies of the endomembrane system have been hindered by contaminating proteins, making it impossible to assign proteins to organelles. Here we have used the localization of organelle proteins by the isotope tagging technique in conjunction with isotope tags for relative and absolute quantitation and 2D liquid chromatography for the simultaneous assignment of proteins to multiple subcellular compartments. With this approach, the density gradient distributions of 689 proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana were determined, enabling confident and simultaneous localization of 527 proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuolar membrane, plasma membrane, or mitochondria and plastids. This parallel analysis of endomembrane components has enabled protein steady-state distributions to be determined. Consequently, genuine organelle residents have been distinguished from contaminating proteins and proteins in transit through the secretory pathway.},

        Abstract = {The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing centre of animal cells and through its influence on the cytoskeleton is involved in cell shape, polarity and motility. It also has a crucial function in cell division because it determines the poles of the mitotic spindle that segregates duplicated chromosomes between dividing cells. Despite the importance of this organelle to cell biology and more than 100 years of study, many aspects of its function remain enigmatic and its structure and composition are still largely unknown. We performed a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of human centrosomes in the interphase of the cell cycle by quantitatively profiling hundreds of proteins across several centrifugation fractions. True centrosomal proteins were revealed by both correlation with already known centrosomal proteins and in vivo localization. We identified and validated 23 novel components and identified 41 likely candidates as well as the vast majority of the known centrosomal proteins in a large background of nonspecific proteins. Protein correlation profiling permits the analysis of any multiprotein complex that can be enriched by fractionation but not purified to homogeneity.},

        Abstract = {The peroxisome represents a ubiquitous single membrane-bound key organelle that executes various metabolic pathways such as fatty acid degradation by alpha- and beta-oxidation, ether-phospholipid biosynthesis, metabolism of reactive oxygen species, and detoxification of glyoxylate in mammals. To fulfil this vast array of metabolic functions, peroxisomes accommodate approximately 50 different enzymes at least as identified until now. Interest in peroxisomes has been fueled by the discovery of a group of genetic diseases in humans, which are caused by either a defect in peroxisome biogenesis or the deficient activity of a distinct peroxisomal enzyme or transporter. Although this research has greatly improved our understanding of peroxisomes and their role in mammalian metabolism, deeper insight into biochemistry and functions of peroxisomes is required to expand our knowledge of this low abundance but vital organelle. In this work, we used classical subcellular fractionation in combination with MS-based proteomics methodologies to characterize the proteome of mouse kidney peroxisomes. We could identify virtually all known components involved in peroxisomal metabolism and biogenesis. Moreover through protein localization studies by using a quantitative MS screen combined with statistical analyses, we identified 15 new peroxisomal candidates. Of these, we further investigated five candidates by immunocytochemistry, which confirmed their localization in peroxisomes. As a result of this joint effort, we believe to have compiled the so far most comprehensive protein catalogue of mammalian peroxisomes.},

        abstract = {Summary: We present an accurate and fast web server, WegoLoc for predicting subcellular localization of proteins based on sequence similarity and weighted Gene Ontology (GO) information. A term weighting method in the text categorization process is applied to GO terms for a support vector machine classifier. As a result, WegoLoc surpasses the state-of-the-art methods for previously used test datasets. WegoLoc supports three eukaryotic kingdoms (animals, fungi and plants) and provides human-specific analysis, and covers several sets of cellular locations. In addition, WegoLoc provides (i) multiple possible localizations of input protein(s) as well as their corresponding probability scores, (ii) weights of GO terms representing the contribution of each GO term in the prediction, and (iii) a BLAST E-value for the best hit with GO terms. If the similarity score does not meet a given threshold, an amino acid composition-based prediction is applied as a backup method. Availability: WegoLoc and User's guide are freely available at the website http://www.btool.org/WegoLoc},

@article{tsne:2008,
    abstract = {{We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that
                  visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each
                  datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional
                  map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic
                  Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is
                  much easier to optimize, and produces significantly
                  better visualizations by reducing the tendency to
                  crowd points together in the center of the
                  map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at
                  creating a single map that reveals structure at many
                  different scales. This is particularly important for
                  high-dimensional data that lie on several different,
                  but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as
                  images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from
                  multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure
                  of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use
                  random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the
                  implicit structure of all of the data to influence
                  the way in which a subset of the data is
                  displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on
                  a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many
                  other non-parametric visualization techniques,
                  including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear
                  Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are
                  significantly better than those produced by the
                  other techniques on almost all of the data sets.}},

        abstract = {Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution
                  of proteins is of vital importance to fully
                  understand context specific protein function. Some
                  proteins can be found with a single location within
                  a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in
                  multiple locations, can dynamically relocalise, or
                  reside within an unknown functional
                  compartment. These considerations lead to
                  uncertainty in associating a protein to a single
                  location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based
                  spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine
                  learning algorithms to assign proteins to
                  sub-cellular locations based on common gradient
                  profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify
                  uncertainty. Here we reformulate the framework on
                  which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a
                  Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian
                  mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically
                  to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a
                  probability distribution over sub-cellular
                  locations, with posterior Bayesian computation
                  performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM)
                  algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo
                  (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide
                  uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further
                  layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our
                  framework is flexible, allowing many different
                  systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling
                  opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our
                  methods perform competitively with the current
                  state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst
                  simultaneously providing more information. We
                  highlight several examples where uncertainty
                  quantification provides biologically intriguing
                  results. To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian
                  model of MS based spatial proteomics data.},

                  Rubin (1992a) for monitoring the convergence of
                  iterative simulations by comparing between and
                  within variances of multiple chains, in order to
                  obtain a family of tests for convergence. We review
                  methods of inference from simulations in order to
                  develop convergence-monitoring summaries that are
                  relevant for the purposes for which the simulations
                  are used. We recommend applying a battery of tests
                  for mixing based on the comparison of inferences
                  from individual sequences and from the mixture of
                  sequences. Finally, we discuss multivariate
                  analogues, for assessing convergence of several
                  parameters simultaneously. }

 abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and
                  similar iterative simulation methods are potentially
                  very helpful for summarizing multivariate
                  distributions. Used naively, however, iterative
                  simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods
                  are simple and generally applicable to the output of
                  any iterative simulation; they are designed for
                  researchers primarily interested in the science
                  underlying the data and models they are analyzing,
                  rather than for researchers interested in the
                  probability theory underlying the iterative
                  simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is
                  to use several independent sequences, with starting
                  points sampled from an overdispersed
                  distribution. At each step of the iterative
                  simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand
                  of interest, a distributional estimate and an
                  estimate of how much sharper the distributional
                  estimate might become if the simulations were
                  continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on
                  applied inference for Bayesian posterior
                  distributions in real problems, which often tend
                  toward normality after transformations and
                  marginalization, we derive our results as
                  normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian
                  inference, conditional on the observed
                  simulations. The methods are illustrated on a
                  random-effects mixture model applied to experimental
                  measurements of reaction times of normal and
                  schizophrenic patients.},

                  vital in defining its function, and a protein's
                  mis-localisation is known to lead to adverse
                  effect. As a result, numerous experimental

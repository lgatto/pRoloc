Protocols continue to increase in complexity as methods and technologies evolve and diversify. To encourage the standardized collection, integration, storage and dissemination of proteomics data, the Human Proteome Organization’s Proteomics Standards Initiative develops guidance modules for reporting the use of techniques such as gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. This paper describes the processes and principles underpinning the development of these modules; discusses the ramifications for various interest groups such as experimentalists, funders, publishers and the private sector; addresses the issue of overlap with other reporting guidelines; and highlights the criticality of appropriate tools and resources in enabling ’MIAPE-compliant’ reporting.},

@Article{Ross2004,
        Abstract = {We describe here a multiplexed protein quantitation strategy that provides relative and absolute measurements of proteins in complex mixtures. At the core of this methodology is a multiplexed set of isobaric reagents that yield amine-derivatized peptides. The derivatized peptides are indistinguishable in MS, but exhibit intense low-mass MS/MS signature ions that support quantitation. In this study, we have examined the global protein expression of a wild-type yeast strain and the isogenic upf1Delta and xrn1Delta mutant strains that are defective in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and the general 5’ to 3’ decay pathways, respectively. We also demonstrate the use of 4-fold multiplexing to enable relative protein measurements simultaneously with determination of absolute levels of a target protein using synthetic isobaric peptide standards. We find that inactivation of Upf1p and Xrn1p causes common as well as unique effects on protein expression.},

	Abstract = {A challenging task in the study of the secretory pathway is the identification and localization of new proteins to increase our understanding of the functions of different organelles. Previous proteomic studies of the endomembrane system have been hindered by contaminating proteins, making it impossible to assign proteins to organelles. Here we have used the localization of organelle proteins by the isotope tagging technique in conjunction with isotope tags for relative and absolute quantitation and 2D liquid chromatography for the simultaneous assignment of proteins to multiple subcellular compartments. With this approach, the density gradient distributions of 689 proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana were determined, enabling confident and simultaneous localization of 527 proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuolar membrane, plasma membrane, or mitochondria and plastids. This parallel analysis of endomembrane components has enabled protein steady-state distributions to be determined. Consequently, genuine organelle residents have been distinguished from contaminating proteins and proteins in transit through the secretory pathway.},

These localizations allowed assessment of the specificity in published organellar proteomic inventories and demonstrate multiple locations for 39% of all organellar proteins.

	Abstract = {The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing centre of animal cells and through its influence on the cytoskeleton is involved in cell shape, polarity and motility. It also has a crucial function in cell division because it determines the poles of the mitotic spindle that segregates duplicated chromosomes between dividing cells. Despite the importance of this organelle to cell biology and more than 100 years of study, many aspects of its function remain enigmatic and its structure and composition are still largely unknown. We performed a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of human centrosomes in the interphase of the cell cycle by quantitatively profiling hundreds of proteins across several centrifugation fractions. True centrosomal proteins were revealed by both correlation with already known centrosomal proteins and in vivo localization. We identified and validated 23 novel components and identified 41 likely candidates as well as the vast majority of the known centrosomal proteins in a large background of nonspecific proteins. Protein correlation profiling permits the analysis of any multiprotein complex that can be enriched by fractionation but not purified to homogeneity.},

	Abstract = {The peroxisome represents a ubiquitous single membrane-bound key organelle that executes various metabolic pathways such as fatty acid degradation by alpha- and beta-oxidation, ether-phospholipid biosynthesis, metabolism of reactive oxygen species, and detoxification of glyoxylate in mammals. To fulfil this vast array of metabolic functions, peroxisomes accommodate approximately 50 different enzymes at least as identified until now. Interest in peroxisomes has been fueled by the discovery of a group of genetic diseases in humans, which are caused by either a defect in peroxisome biogenesis or the deficient activity of a distinct peroxisomal enzyme or transporter. Although this research has greatly improved our understanding of peroxisomes and their role in mammalian metabolism, deeper insight into biochemistry and functions of peroxisomes is required to expand our knowledge of this low abundance but vital organelle. In this work, we used classical subcellular fractionation in combination with MS-based proteomics methodologies to characterize the proteome of mouse kidney peroxisomes. We could identify virtually all known components involved in peroxisomal metabolism and biogenesis. Moreover through protein localization studies by using a quantitative MS screen combined with statistical analyses, we identified 15 new peroxisomal candidates. Of these, we further investigated five candidates by immunocytochemistry, which confirmed their localization in peroxisomes. As a result of this joint effort, we believe to have compiled the so far most comprehensive protein catalogue of mammalian peroxisomes.},

	abstract = {Summary: We present an accurate and fast web server, WegoLoc for predicting subcellular localization of proteins based on sequence similarity and weighted Gene Ontology (GO) information. A term weighting method in the text categorization process is applied to GO terms for a support vector machine classifier. As a result, WegoLoc surpasses the state-of-the-art methods for previously used test datasets. WegoLoc supports three eukaryotic kingdoms (animals, fungi and plants) and provides human-specific analysis, and covers several sets of cellular locations. In addition, WegoLoc provides (i) multiple possible localizations of input protein(s) as well as their corresponding probability scores, (ii) weights of GO terms representing the contribution of each GO term in the prediction, and (iii) a BLAST E-value for the best hit with GO terms. If the similarity score does not meet a given threshold, an amino acid composition-based prediction is applied as a backup method. Availability: WegoLoc and User's guide are freely available at the website http://www.btool.org/WegoLoc},
